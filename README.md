# Minesweeper
# Description
I really wanted to see if I could code this within a day and I actually was able to. It was so much fun and I enjoyed being able to figure out the entire process without outside help. The output format does look a little off for bigger grid sizes, so please excuse that.

# Gameplay

# Installation
Download the two .py files and ensure they are in the same folder. Then run the game.py file. Choose the grid size of your choosing. To make moons you will need to type the command in the terminal. The first letter will be either R to reveal a cell, or F to put a flag on a cell. The letter should be followed by the row number and the column number all seperated by spaces. If you reveal a bomb, the game ends and the grid is revealed. If you reveal every cell other than the bombs, you win.
You will have to download the termcolor library to your computer as it is used to pretty print the grid to the terminal. Use this command in your terminal; py -m pip install termcolor
