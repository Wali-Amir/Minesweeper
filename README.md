You can download this project to your computer and play the game as much as you want. It would actually make me happy to hear about someone doing that. You are welcome to make changes to the code and improve it where you believe it is applicable. I kindly request that you refrain from copying this project and using it as your submission in school or university. I would urge you to build a project from scratch because this was a very rewarding experience. Happy coding!
